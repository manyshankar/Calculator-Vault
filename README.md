• Designed and implemented a fully functional calculator interface with standard arithmetic operations

(addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

• Built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for intuitive interaction and smooth performance.

• Integrated vault-like functionality to securely store/retrieve hidden content or protected data behind the

calculator interface.

• Used JavaScript logic and event handling to manage both calculator operations and vault access.
